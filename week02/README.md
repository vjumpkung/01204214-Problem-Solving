- ku01_distinct (solution must be O(n^2))
- ku01_cars (optional) (solution must be O(n))
- necklace (union set disjoint is alternative solution)
- chains (optional) HARDEST!!!!!!!!

*** chains
( every operation have to be O(1) in worst case except reverse because O(p) when p mean number of join pairs )
